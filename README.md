# MyModule
Software to simulate a collection of stars near the Andromeda galaxy.

## Intent
Simulate a catalogue of foreground stars in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy. The initial requirements are as follows:
- Stars should have randomized sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
-  Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
-  Each star should have a unique ID
-  The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analyzed by other programs

## Installing
Use `pip install git+<link>`, or download and run `pip install .`

## Usage
`sky_sim` or `runme` are the two command line entry points.
They have no parameters or options that can be set
